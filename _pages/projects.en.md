This page summarizes my projects and replications in multi-robot systems, embodied intelligence, and 3D scene generation (continuously updated).

## Track 1: Multi-robot Systems
- Distributed exploration / search and tracking (SSAT)
- Distributed coordination and task allocation
- Robust cooperation under communication constraints

## Track 2: Embodied Intelligence & VLA
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policy learning and evaluation
- World Models, planning, and reasoning

## Track 3: 3D Scene Understanding & Generation
- 3DGS / NeRF replications and scene editing
- Semantic consistency and controllable generation

## Notes
- For each project, I will progressively add: overview, key techniques, my contributions, links to code/papers, and reproduction instructions.
