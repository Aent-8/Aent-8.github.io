A living list of open questions and research prompts. Suggestions are welcome.

## Multi-robot Systems
- How can exploration and target tracking be balanced under limited communication and occlusion?
- What guarantees can be provided for coverage quality in unknown non-convex environments?

## 3D Scene Generation
- How can geometric priors improve semantic consistency in single-image 3D generation?
- What evaluation metrics best reflect controllable scene editing quality?

## Systems and Deployment
- How can multi-robot mesh networks maintain robustness under intermittent links?
- What are practical benchmarks for end-to-end autonomy in cluttered environments?
