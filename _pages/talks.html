Selected research and engineering projects, with an emphasis on multi-robot systems and 3D scene understanding.

## Research Projects

### Multi-UAV Mesh Networking and Localization System for Live-line Safety Operations
*National Undergraduate Innovation Project, project lead.*

- Built a multi-UAV mesh network and improved OLSR routing with ETX-based link quality to reduce dropouts.
- Integrated RTK + UWB fusion and ESO dual-loop disturbance rejection for centimeter-level positioning and stable hovering.
- Implemented ROS + AirSim simulation and hardware validation.

### DreamVGGT: VGGT-Guided Generative 3D Gaussian Splatting
- Single-image 3D scene customization with geometric-semantic alignment.
- Related paper and demo: [DreamVGGT](/publication/dreamvggt/).

### Distributed Multi-Robot Multi-Target Search and Tracking
- Joint exploration, coverage, and tracking in unknown non-convex environments.
- Related paper and demo: [SSAT](/publication/ssat/).

### FPGA-Based Football Match Analysis System (ZYNQ-7020)
- Built a heterogeneous FPGA+ARM pipeline for real-time football analytics (Jiangsu “苏超” league scenario).
- YOLOv8 pruning/quantization for lightweight detection; PyQt5 UI for visualization and replay.
- ~10 fps, <100 ms latency; supports player/ball tracking, event detection, and radar-view tactics.
- Report: [PDF](/files/projects/project-report-1107.pdf)

### FPGA-Based Elderly Fall Detection (ZYNQ-7020 + YOLOv7)
- Embedded fall-detection system on ZYNQ-7020 with YOLOv7 pruning/quantization.
- Hardware–software co-design: convolution acceleration on PL, control and classification on PS.
- Targets low-latency, low-power monitoring for home and clinical scenarios.
- Report: [PDF](/files/projects/fpga-report-11-11.pdf)

### ALOHA Policy Reproduction (In Progress)
- Reproducing the ALOHA bimanual manipulation policy: data pipeline, training stack, and benchmarking tasks.
- Focus on teleoperation data collection, imitation learning, and sim-to-real evaluation.
- Integrating perception (RGB-D/3D) and control interfaces for hardware experiments.
