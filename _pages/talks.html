Selected research and engineering projects, with an emphasis on multi-robot systems and 3D scene understanding.

## Research Projects

### Multi-UAV Mesh Networking and Localization System for Live-line Safety Operations
*National Undergraduate Innovation Project, project lead.*

- Built a multi-UAV mesh network and improved OLSR routing with ETX-based link quality to reduce dropouts.
- Integrated RTK + UWB fusion and ESO dual-loop disturbance rejection for centimeter-level positioning and stable hovering.
- Implemented ROS + AirSim simulation and hardware validation.

### DreamVGGT: VGGT-Guided Generative 3D Gaussian Splatting
- Single-image 3D scene customization with geometric-semantic alignment.
- Related paper and demo: [DreamVGGT](/publication/dreamvggt/).

### Distributed Multi-Robot Multi-Target Search and Tracking
- Joint exploration, coverage, and tracking in unknown non-convex environments.
- Related paper and demo: [SSAT](/publication/ssat/).
