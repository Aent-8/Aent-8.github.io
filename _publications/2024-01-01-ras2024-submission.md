**Abstract:** This work studies distributed multi-robot area examination and target search in known environments with limited sensor field-of-view. We compare a greedy exploitation strategy with a Thompson-sampling approach that balances exploration and exploitation, showing higher efficiency than baseline sweeping in clustered-target scenarios.
