**Abstract:** Motivated by coral reef information gathering using multiple unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) under the sea,this paper addresses the problem of distributed multi-robot area examination and target search, which requires a teamof robots to select, navigate to, and look over a sequence of locations in a known area to search for targets of interest.Robots must reduce the speed during close examination to acquisitive precise information of examined locations anddetect if targets exist or not. The key technical challenges for efficiently complete such tasks stem from the factsthat the robot has limited sensor field of view and is required to perform the search and examination of targets overan extended area without prior knowledge on their distribution. In such scenario, it is computationally intractable todesign the optimal strategy to minimize the time it takes to find all targets. In this paper, we compare two novel targetsearch strategies, the greedy algorithm that thoroughly exploits a detected target cluster, and a Thompson-sampling-based algorithm that balances the trade-off between exploitation – further surveying surroundings of target-detectedareas–and exploration – traveling to a randomly selected un-visited area. Simulations are carried out to validate theefficiency of the proposed methods for tasks in which targets are clustered and precise examination is required fortarget search compared to a baseline sweeping algorithm.
