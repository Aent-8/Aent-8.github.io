**Status:** Submitted.

**Abstract:** We propose DreamVGGT, a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based generation with explicit VGGT geometric guidance to produce high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splatting from a single image. An uncertainty-aware depth-semantic-point optimization aligns geometry and semantics for controllable object insertion, removal, and deformation.
