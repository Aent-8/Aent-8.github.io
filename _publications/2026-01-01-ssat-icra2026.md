**Abstract:** In unknown non-convex environments, such as indoor and underground spaces, deploying a fleet of robots to explore the surroundings while simultaneously searching for and tracking targets of interest to maintain high-precision data collection represents a fundamental challenge that urgently requires resolution in applications such as environmental monitoring and rescue operations. Current research has made significant progress in addressing environmental exploration, information search, and target tracking problems, but has yet to establish a framework for simultaneously optimizing these tasks in complex environments.  In this paper, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm framework that integrates three control strategies: a frontier-based exploration strategy, a guaranteed coverage strategy based on Lloyd's algorithm, and a sensor-based multi-target tracking strategy.   By incorporating these three strategies, the proposed algorithm balances coverage search and high-precision active tracking during exploration.  Our approach is validated through a series of MATLAB simulations, demonstrating validity and superiority over standard approaches.
