**Abstract:** We present a motion-planning framework for multi-robot search and tracking in unknown non-convex environments. The method integrates frontier-based exploration, Lloyd-based coverage, and sensor-driven tracking to balance coverage search and precise active tracking, validated through MATLAB simulations.
